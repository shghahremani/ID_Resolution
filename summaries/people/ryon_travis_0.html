	<h2>Ryon Travis</h2>
	<p>Ryon Travis didn't just brutalize women, the feds say.

		He also hurt children in a brothel he ran out of his Detroit home, where, they say, he enslaved women, sold them for sex on the internet and took sexually explicit photos of minors and sold them online.

		Among his victims, authorities say, was a woman he chained to a stripper pole by the neck to keep her from leaving. She is now free. Travis is not.</p>
